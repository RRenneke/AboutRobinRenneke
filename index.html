        <div class="text">Hi! I am Robin.
            <p>Fun Fact: I like my drinking water to be room temperature. When I go to restaurants, I ask for a glass of water with no ice. I often get odd looks. Especially, in the Texas heat.</p>

      <h4 class="alert-heading">Introduction</h4>
        <p>I was born and raised in Minnesota. Yes, the winters are cold and I don't miss them. I do miss the 'lake life'. Being able to go for a swim or enjoy the water on the 10,000 lakes, is easy to love. My favorite place is outdoors.  I like to camp, hike, cycle, SUP, and many other outdoor activities. If I am not being active, reading a book on the patio with a glass of red wine is a nice way to spend an evening.</p>
        <p>I have a knack for organizing. I am excited to be a developer because it will allow me to creatively solve problems in an organized fashion. I have years of experience working directly with clients. I know this will benefit me in my developer career. I understand there is never just one stakeholder. The enduser, the client, the broker, the Account Manager, all have an opinion. I am able to listen to someone tell me what they think they want and ask valuable leading questions to understand what they actually need. I am ready to take my client facing, requirements gathering, soft skills to actually create the product.</p>
