      <h4 class="alert-heading">Robin Renneke: Introduction</h4>
        <p>I was born and raised in Minnesota. Yes, the winters are cold and I don't miss them. I do miss the 'lake life'. Being able to go for a swim or enjoy the water on the 10,000 lakes, is easy to love. My favorite place is outdoors.  I like to camp, hike, cycle, SUP, and many other outdoor activities. Minnesota has lots birch trees making hiking even more pretty. If I am not being active, reading a book on the patio with a glass of red wine is a nice way to spend an evening.</p>
        <p>I have a knack for organizing. I am excited to be a developer because it will allow me to creatively solve problems in an organized fashion. I have years of experience working directly with clients. I know this will benefit me in my developer career. I understand there is never just one stakeholder. The enduser, the client, the broker, the Account Manager, all have an opinion. I am able to listen to someone tell me what they think they want and ask valuable leading questions to understand what they actually need. I am ready to take my client facing, requirements gathering, soft skills to actually create the product.</p>

                <p>I like my drinking water to be room temperature.</p> 
                <p>When I go to restaurants, I ask for a glass of water with no ice. I often get odd looks. Especially, in the Texas heat.</p>

        <p>Hopeful of the position of Front-End Developer that gives room for the utilization of exceptional communication and growth. Recently earned a certificate in full stack development from Southern Methodist University. Newly developed skills in HTML, CSS, various CSS frameworks, and JavaScript. With most of my career in a client facing role, I have experience in requirements gathering, meeting deadlines, balancing priorities, and project management. Being the liaison between external and internal stakeholders, I have worked on agile teams to complete and present projects. Due to the uniqueness of the client set I was assigned, I have worked closely with technology teams. Being able to observe made me realize my true passion of working in the technology space.</p>
